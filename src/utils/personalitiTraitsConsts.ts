      "An introverted person tends to be more reserved, introspective, and thoughtful. They may feel more comfortable in quiet, solitary environments and may need time alone to recharge their energy. Introverts often prefer meaningful conversations with a few close friends over large social gatherings, and may feel drained or overwhelmed in highly stimulating or noisy environments. They may be more internally focused, reflecting on their own thoughts and feelings, and may be more cautious when making decisions.",
